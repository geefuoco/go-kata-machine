# Katas for Go
___

## What is a Kata ?

> a system of individual training exercises

Basically, a bunch of algorithms and data structures for you to implement and run tests on

## How do I get started ? 

The katas are written for Go. If you do not have go, download it [here](https://go.dev/dl/)
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/geefuoco/go-kata-machine`
2. Cd into directory `cd go-kata-machine`
3. Run main file to generate katas `go run src/main.go`

A directory `katas` will be made in the root folder.

After implementing, you can run against test cases `go test ./katas/tests/<filename>`

#### Data Structures
- singly linked list
- doubly linked list
- hashmap
- trie
- stack
- queue
- max heap

#### Algorithms
- binary search (arrays)
- quick sort (arrays)
- merge sort (arrays)
- detect cycle in directed graph (graphs)
- number of items (dynamic programming)
- convert edge list to graph (graphs)
- number of buildings served (arrays)
- shortest path (graph)
- largest component (graph)
